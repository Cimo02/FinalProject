# Milestone 2

Report of progress for Milestone 2

Group E
Date: April 8, 2019
Class: 13.1

## About this Milestone 

At this point, you should have base research done on the technologies to use and have your workflow in place. Your focus this week should be on building and developing your program. Next Monday will be Milestone 3, where you will demonstrate your app to the professor. You will need to describe the parts that members contributed. The app will not have to be fully integrated for Milestone 3, but does need to be a working minimally viable product by Milestone 4 for class play test. 

## Questions to Answer for Milestone 2

### Do you have your technologies/SDKs researched? 

List technologies here as well as anything requires further research:

* Unity: 2018.3.7f1
* ARCore: ARCore for Unity 1.8.0
* Hardware: Android

### What is the vision for the application you are committing to for the next milestone?

We want our application to be able to place models of glasses on the users head. ARCore will recognize their face and determine where to place the model. 
* App opens 
* App recognizes your face
* App places glasses model

### Do you have a workflow in place? 

Yes, we have some issues created on GitHub for the general milestones for development but we need to add more for what goes into those larger issues.

### Do you have a common project started?

Yes.

### Do you have major blocking issues at this time?

Yes, we currently do not have hardware that can run the app. 

### How will you be employing sound? 

Sound in our app will be used for feedback on interactions. For example, a "swoosh" noise when changing glasses or a "click" when pressing a button.
